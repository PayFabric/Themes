# Summary
For merchants who want to integrate with the PayFabric hosted payment page and the hosted wallet page, custom css code can be added into the hosted page to fit the overall style of a 3rd party application. To implement a custom theme, some preliminary configuration is needed to setup the PayFabric account. Please refer to this [section](https://github.com/PayFabric/Portal/blob/master/PayFabric/Sections/Themes.md) for more details.
